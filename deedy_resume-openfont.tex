% on which the font is used and either change it to a font included with your
% operating system or comment the line out to use the default font.

% TODO:
% 1. Integrate biber/bibtex for article citation under publications.
% 2. Figure out a smoother way for the document to flow onto the next page.
% 3. Add styling information for a "Projects/Hacks" section.
% 4. Add location/address information
% 5. Merge OpenFont and MacFonts as a single sty with options.
% 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% CHANGELOG:
% v1.1:
% 1. Fixed several compilation bugs with \renewcommand
% 2. Got Open-source fonts (Windows/Linux support)
% 3. Added Last Updated
% 4. Move Title styling into .sty
% 5. Commented .sty file.
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% Known Issues:
% 1. Overflows onto second page if any column's contents are more than the

\runsubsection{Gesture controlled robotic arm}
\descript{| Leader Robotics Society NITH}
The 3D Model is a representation of a human arm. First, I modelled it using SOLIDWORKS and then I transferred it into Matlab / Simulink using the SimMechanics Link from Mat works.\\
Tools used were SOLIDWORKS, Matlab Simulation.
The code comes with the package (Arduino IO package) to enable the Simulink library.

\runsubsection{Obstacle Avoidance Robot with AI Integration}
\descript{| Robotics Society NITH}
It was an intelligent device that can automatically sense the obstacle in front of it and avoid them by turning itself in
another direction.
We used C++ language. I have done the hardware part and give training to the Bot.
